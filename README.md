# 100DaysOfCode

This is a repository for my #100DaysOfCode challenge, where I will be sharing my learnings and the code I write in C++ and C for the next 100 days. The purpose of this challenge is to improve my programming skills, build my portfolio, and connect with other developers.

# What to expect 
In this repository, you will find my daily progress logs, where I will share what I learned, what I worked on, and any challenges or successes I encountered. I will also be uploading the code I write each day, organized by day and topic. 

# Technology Stack
The code in this repository is primarily written in C++ and C.

# Contribution Guidelines
This repository is a personal project, but I welcome contributions and feedback from other developers
